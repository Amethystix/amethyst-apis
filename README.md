# Amethyst API
An api made to be consumed by my website and blog (coming soon).  It features the ability to get my blog entries from a database, as well as all other functionality of my site.  

# Features

## What am I up to?
One endpoint of my API is able to, using the time of the request being sent, grab a current activity from a list that I've entered, thus allowing my website to display a graphic showing a 'status' in the header based on the response.

## Blog
My API also contains endpoints that allow for searching, finding, and rendering blog posts from a database.

It also will allow for users to comment on the blogs, and will then store those comments in the database.

# Version
Currently unfinished, with some activities input and the endpoint working.  The database is not yet configured, and the blog entires are not yet finalized in structure.  However, right now, everything is wireframed and has endpoints created.
